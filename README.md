# Tourism Website

Welcome to the Tourism Website project! This website showcases some of the most iconic tourist destinations in India, including the Taj Mahal, Golden Temple, Mysore Palace, and Varanasi Temple. The platform allows users to explore these locations in detail, view image carousels, and navigate through different sections with ease.

## Key Features

- Interactive Homepage: A welcoming page with a "Get Started" button to begin the journey through famous tourist spots.
- Favorite Places: A list of notable Indian tourist attractions with brief descriptions and images.
- Detailed Views: Clickable destinations that open detailed views, complete with image carousels and rich descriptions of each location.
- Seamless Navigation: Easy transitions between sections, with back buttons to return to previous views.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: For creating the structure of the website.
- CSS3: For styling, including layout and design enhancements.
- Bootstrap 4: Utilized for responsive design, carousels, and UI components.
- JavaScript: Implements interactivity such as section navigation and image carousel functionality.

## How to Run the Project Locally

To view the website on your own machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local computer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tourism-website.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd tourism-website
   ```

3. **Open the index.html** file in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

This will launch the website in your browser where you can explore the tourist destinations and interact with the carousels.

## How It Works

The website is divided into three main sections:

1. Home: The landing page with a "Get Started" button that leads you to the favorite places.
   
2. Favorite Places: A collection of popular Indian tourist spots with a brief description and an image. You can click on any of these places to explore more.
   
3. Detailed View: Each tourist spot has its own detailed section with a carousel of images and a full description. A "Back" button is provided to return to the previous section.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for expanding this project in the future:

- User Profiles: Allow users to save their favorite places and create a custom itinerary.
- Google Maps Integration: Display the geographical location of each tourist spot on an embedded map.
- More Locations: Add additional tourist spots to the site.
- Performance Optimization: Improve load times by optimizing images and adding lazy loading.
